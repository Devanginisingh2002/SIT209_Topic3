        <p>Hi, I m Devangini. I belong to Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. Currently, I m pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in computer science. Personally, I believe this field is very vast and enhance to think in a different way.</p>
        <p>I achieve knowledge of programming and software. I have already completed eleven units, from the first semester till now.</p>

        <h2>About Units Cover</h2>

        <p>In the first semester: I study SIT192 Discrete Mathematics, SIT101 Introduction to programming, SIT111 Algorithms and computing systems, and SEB101 Engineering Physics.</p>
        <p>In the second semester: I study SIT217 Software Engineering 1 - Robotics Project, SIT103 Data and Information Management, SIT123 Data Capture Technologies, SIT232 Object-Oriented Development.</p>
        <p>In the third semester: I study SEJ101 Design Fundamentals, SIT210 Embedded Systems Development, SIT221 Data Structures, and Algorithms.</p>

        <h3>What did I learn?</h3>

        <p>In all these units, I learned new things in all from the units such as, In the semester first I understand C++ and Python programming languages and advance of discrete mathematics and basic of Physics.</p>
        <p>In the second semester, personally, I believe this semester took the course to a different level because I learned a lot of new things such as how to program using hardware such as Arduino boards and RPI, and in this, we made a group project in robotics as CamBot. Also, one individual project is also there with help of Tinker-cad software I made connections assemble hardware, and made Social Distancing Devices. C# programming languages and SQL commands were also learned in the semester.</p>
        <p>In the third semester, I understand the programming of raspberry pi and the basics of Data structures. Basically, I learn about the Fusion software for designing purposes.</p>
        
        <h4>Summarise Of Activites</h4>
        <h5>Activity 1</h5>

        <p>This activity is about IoT Apps as IoT applications, What are the main features, and what are some examples of that. I learned about IoT applications it runs on IoT devices and can be created to be specific to almost every industry, smart appliances, including health care, and more.</p>
        <p>Mainly, it is an interface connecting hardware along with the provision of various features connected through the means of the internet. Some examples are as follows, Smart homes, wearable devices(watches) connected cars or more.</p>
        
        <h6>Activity 2</h6>

        <p>This activity is about a smart building, what do smart means, scenarios of a smart building, and the main features needed to build smart buildings. During the activity, I completely understand that with the help of the internet what we can do is make smart things. </p>
        <p>Smart means the right use of technology to solve complex problems in a simple manner. The main requirement to make things smart is feasible, economically viable, central control on data and resources, energy-efficient, and telecommunications. Also, efficient sensors, actuators, smart lights, smart echo systems are important for smart buildings. </p>
        
        <h7>Activity 3</h7>
        
        <p>This activity is about Control Interface, in this, I learned what are the high-level requirements, who uses the control interface, what parts are needed most. I study the control interface it refers to the input devices and interfaces, for example, mouse, joystick, keyboard or eye gaze camera or audible (e.g., screen reader software or auditory scanning).</p>
        <p>The required feature is an accessible UI, machine learning, remote access, and easily embedded in other systems.</p>
